## üöÄ Getting Started

### **Frontend Setup**
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:5173
```

### **.NET Backend Setup (Optional)**
```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Restore .NET dependencies
dotnet restore

# Update database (uses LocalDB by default)
cd EduCMS.Api
dotnet ef database update

# Start the API
dotnet run

# API available at http://localhost:5000
# Swagger UI at http://localhost:5000
```

### **Docker Development (Full Stack)**
```bash
# Start both frontend and backend with Docker
cd backend
docker-compose up -d

# Frontend: http://localhost:3000 (if configured)
# API: http://localhost:5000
# SQL Server: localhost:1433
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with design system tokens
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui
- **State Management**: React Query + Context API
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture - Dual Implementation

**Full-Stack Development Showcase**: The application supports two backend implementations, demonstrating both modern BaaS and enterprise API development:

#### **Option 1: Supabase Backend (Default)**
```typescript
// Supabase BaaS Implementation
- Authentication: Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
- Database: PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS)
- Storage: Supabase Storage for file uploads
- Real-time: WebSocket subscriptions
```

#### **Option 2: .NET Core API Backend (Enterprise)**
```csharp
// ASP.NET Core Web API Implementation
- Architecture: Clean Architecture with SOLID principles
- Database: SQL Server with Entity Framework Core
- Authentication: JWT Bearer tokens (compatible with frontend)
- Patterns: Repository, Unit of Work, Dependency Injection
- Documentation: Swagger/OpenAPI with comprehensive examples
- Deployment: Docker containerization with health checks
```

**Switch Between Backends**: Set `VITE_USE_DOTNET_API=true` to use the .NET backend
