# EduCMS Project Summary & Next Steps

## 📋 **Executive Summary**

The EduCMS (Educational Content Management System) is a **70% complete** React-based web application with a solid foundation and several key features already implemented. The project demonstrates professional development practices with modern technologies and is well-positioned for completion.

### 🎯 **Current State**
- **✅ Strong Foundation**: Modern React 18 + TypeScript + Vite setup
- **✅ Professional UI**: Complete shadcn/ui component library implementation
- **✅ Backend Integration**: Supabase authentication and database configured
- **✅ Core Features**: Dashboard, authentication, and basic CRUD operations working
- **🔄 Partial Implementation**: Several features are 60-80% complete
- **❌ Critical Gap**: File upload/storage system not implemented

### 🚀 **Immediate Priority Actions**

#### 1. **CRITICAL: Complete File Upload System** (3-4 days)
**Why Critical**: This is the most significant missing piece that affects the Documents feature entirely.

**Tasks**:
- Configure Supabase Storage buckets
- Implement file upload component with drag-and-drop
- Add file preview and download functionality
- Update Documents page to use real file handling
- Add proper error handling and progress indicators

#### 2. **HIGH: API Consolidation** (2-3 days)
**Why Important**: Currently using both mock and Supabase APIs, creating confusion and maintenance issues.

**Tasks**:
- Remove `src/lib/mockApi.ts` completely
- Update all components to use Supabase APIs exclusively
- Ensure all CRUD operations work properly
- Fix any type mismatches

#### 3. **HIGH: Feature Completion** (4-5 days)
**Why Important**: Several features are 80% complete and need finishing touches.

**Tasks**:
- Add rich text editor to announcements
- Implement student profile photos
- Add bulk import/export for students
- Complete reports with charts and PDF export
